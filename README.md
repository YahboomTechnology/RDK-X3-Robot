# Introduction
RDK X3 development board is equipped with the ROS2 operating system, which endows this AI vision car with excellent functions and mobility. RDK X3 robot car is designed with Mecanum wheels, so it can move flexibly and freely in various environments. Its combination of depth camera and lidar enables it to accurately identify and track targets, and realize intelligent navigation and obstacle avoidance functions. Through Jupyter Lab Python programming and deep learning algorithms, the car can identify, classify and analyze the surrounding scenery in real time, so as to achieve a higher level of intelligent decision-making and interaction.

* Strong computing power
  Using the new RDK-X3 development board, it has enough computing resources to handle real-time data and complex computing tasks. Combining Python programming and ROS2 operating system, user can develop various intelligent algorithms.

* Cost-effective hardware configuration
  The car is equipped with Mecanum wheels, depth cameras, TOF lidar, which can realize map-building navigation, intelligent obstacle avoidance, gesture control, visual line inspection and other functions.

* Support multiple remote control methods
  Users can control the car through mobile phone APP, PS2 controller, computer keyboard, and ROS operating system. And we have also specially developed a mapping navigation APP for it, so that user can realize mapping navigation anytime.

* Aluminum alloy structure, stacked structure
  RDK X3 car is made of white sandblasted aluminum alloy as a whole, and the interior adopts a stacked structure. All the connecting wires are cleverly stored, making the car look beautiful and tidy as a whole.
